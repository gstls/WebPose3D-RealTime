# Introduction
- This project utilizes MediaPipe and A-Frame to render joints in a virtual environment in real time.
- Mediapipe is a body-tracking framework developed by Google. [More information about mediapipe](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe)

## Real-Time Pose Estimation: Accuracy vs. Efficiency
- Lightweight pose estimation models, such as MediaPipe, often suffer from reduced accuracy and consistency.
- Meanwhile, accuracy-focused models are too heavy, making them less practical for real-world applications.
- This project aims to find an optimal balance between the accuracy and computational cost of pose estimation models. Furthermore, it enhances scalability for real-time applications.

## Project Overview
-This project selects only the minimal set of joints necessary to identify the user's posture.
